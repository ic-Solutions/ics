They even helped in suggesting better options in terms of the design and layouts. The team is extremely professional and friendly, they listened to all our requirements and ensured that they are all met with.

  thoughts: We had outsourced the Website Development of our photography company Graphika Memento to ICS Solutions. They followed a very stringent timeline throughout  the project. They took timely follow-ups for the contents to be handed over from our end for the web development to make sure the project could be delivered as per deadlines. Also, they quickly response to all communication. They are quite professional when it comes to dealing with their clients. They also gave wise and honest suggestions in terms of what templates we should use, how much we should spend on website . They paid attention to all details for design and content on website. Also, they take into consideration user experience while developing the website. I would recommend ICS to other customers for sure.
