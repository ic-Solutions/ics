  thoughts: '"Service above self" is the motto of Rotary International. As a service based organization we needed a well established face online to put forward our work and attract more people to our cause. We "partnered in service" with ICS to help us achieve this task and they have not let us down. They delivered a feature-rich website with really good SEO work that has brought our club to light. Having such a strong online presence has made us very noticeable even outside our community.'

  thoughts: We had outsourced the Website Development of our photography company Graphika Memento to ICS Solutions. They followed a very stringent timeline throughout  the project. They took timely follow-ups for the contents to be handed over from our end for the web development to make sure the project could be delivered as per deadlines. Also, they quickly response to all communication. They are quite professional when it comes to dealing with their clients. They also gave wise and honest suggestions in terms of what templates we should use, how much we should spend on website . They paid attention to all details for design and content on website. Also, they take into consideration user experience while developing the website. I would recommend ICS to other customers for sure.
